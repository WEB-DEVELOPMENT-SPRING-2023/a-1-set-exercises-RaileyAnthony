    <p class="margin">Five Feet Apart, the 2018 novel by Rachael Lippincott, Mikki Daughtry, and Tobias Iaconis, tells the story of two teenagers who fall in love but are kept apart, both physically and emotionally, by their illness. Originally introduced as polar opposites, the storyâ€™s protagonists, Stella and Will, are cystic fibrosis patients who cannot get within six feet of each other without risking infection. However, they find a way to take back something from the illness that has taken so much from them: one full foot. This bestselling novel was adapted into a film in 2019, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson.</p>
