    <h2 id="overview">Plot</h2>
    <p class="margin">Seventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, an impossibly charming teen who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction.</p>
    <h2 id="keyinfo">Key Information</h2>
    <p class="margin">Five Feet Apart, the 2018 novel by Rachael Lippincott, Mikki Daughtry, and Tobias Iaconis, tells the story of two teenagers who fall in love but are kept apart, both physically and emotionally, by their illness. Originally introduced as polar opposites, the story’s protagonists, Stella and Will, are cystic fibrosis patients who cannot get within six feet of each other without risking infection. However, they find a way to take back something from the illness that has taken so much from them: one full foot. This bestselling novel was adapted into a film in 2019, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson.</p>

        <p class="mreview">"I thoroughly enjoyed Five Feet Apart and 10/10 would recommend it for anyone who’s looking for a good story above everything else. The direction the movie took made for a surprising outcome and even though you could argue the ending was a bit ambiguous in some way; it was satisfying because it was real."</p>

        <p class="mreview">As ok-ishly directed and executed as Five Feet Apart was, I thought that the plot line of the film was horrible. I understand how a film is thematically (and literary) well composed if the protagonist or atleast one of the protagonists underwent some horrible tragic death or perhaps the menace of an admirable character, however- even though i am myself one to love such an epic ending of the predicted yet dreaded  fatalism of the dramatis personas-  felt as though it was inappropriate and somewhat cruel-some for Justin Baldoni to embark and embellish on such a sudden advance of heartache in the film especially seeing as the book clearly makes room for hope as they meet each other at the airport before their departures.  </p>

        <p class="mreview">I am feeling so amazed after watching the movie. This movie is too great. The direction, writing, screenplay, and everything was magnificent. Especially being a Cole Sprouse fan, I was so excited for this movie. After watching it, I started loving Haley Lu Richardson. She is so talented and a very good actress.</p>

This tear jerker flick, sails you right into their world and you are bound to love your own life more. The songs and background score adds to the charm to this beautiful movie. As viewer you must give it a chance to enroll you in their emotional ride. </p>
