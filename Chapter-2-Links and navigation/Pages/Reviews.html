    <p class="mreview">"I thoroughly enjoyed Five Feet Apart and 10/10 would recommend it for anyone whoâ€™s looking for a good story above everything else. The direction the movie took made for a surprising outcome and even though you could argue the ending was a bit ambiguous in some way; it was satisfying because it was real."</p>

    <h3>"Five Feet Apart is not well made"</h3>

    <p class="mreview">As ok-ishly directed and executed as Five Feet Apart was, I thought that the plot line of the film was horrible. I understand how a film is thematically (and literary) well composed if the protagonist or atleast one of the protagonists underwent some horrible tragic death or perhaps the menace of an admirable character, however- even though i am myself one to love such an epic ending of the predicted yet dreaded  fatalism of the dramatis personas-  felt as though it was inappropriate and somewhat cruel-some for Justin Baldoni to embark and embellish on such a sudden advance of heartache in the film especially seeing as the book clearly makes room for hope as they meet each other at the airport before their departures.  </p>

    <p class="mreview">I am feeling so amazed after watching the movie. This movie is too great. The direction, writing, screenplay, and everything was magnificent. Especially being a Cole Sprouse fan, I was so excited for this movie. After watching it, I started loving Haley Lu Richardson. She is so talented and a very good actress.</p>
