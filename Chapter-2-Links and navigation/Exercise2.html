    <h1 id="overview">Overview of Five Feet Apart</h1>
    <p>Seventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control -- all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, an impossibly charming teen who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction.</p>
    <h1 id="keyinfo">Key Information about Five Feet Apart</h1>
    <p>Five Feet Apart, the 2018 novel by Rachael Lippincott, Mikki Daughtry, and Tobias Iaconis, tells the story of two teenagers who fall in love but are kept apart, both physically and emotionally, by their illness. Originally introduced as polar opposites, the storyâ€™s protagonists, Stella and Will, are cystic fibrosis patients who cannot get within six feet of each other without risking infection. However, they find a way to take back something from the illness that has taken so much from them: one full foot. This bestselling novel was adapted into a film in 2019, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson.</p>
